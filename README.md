# Know How

**Work in progress** - currently copying old stuff over and organizing it, please come back in 2-4 weeks

This repository collects stuff i am most interested in. It should become my big reference book.

**Attention**

There is quite some experimental and vague claims in here, especially when it comes to performance and low level hardware things.
I just note down my thoughts and results of my experiments and as so often I might take away wrong conclusions from those experiments.
So basically what I want to say is: Take some stuff, especially those marked *experimental*, with a grain of salt.

Everyone is highly welcome to contribute/improve/correct things.

* Ratings are from 1 to 10, 10 is best
* *Experimental*: Stuff i just tried out or where I havent done enough experiments to back up my statements
* Everything marked with a question mark (?) needs more investigation
