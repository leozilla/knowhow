## Go Proverbs

https://go-proverbs.github.io/

 * Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating
 * Concurrency is not parallelism
 * Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize
 * The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction
 * Make the zero value useful
 * interface{} says nothing
 * Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite
 * A little copying is better than a little dependency
 * Syscall must always be guarded with build tags
 * Cgo must always be guarded with build tags
 * Cgo is not Go
 * With the unsafe package there are no guarantees
 * Clear is better than clever
 * Reflection is never clear
 * Errors are values
 * Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully
 * Design the architecture, name the components, document the details
 * Documentation is for users
 * Don't panic
